This module defines the abstract base classes (interfaces) for the core
components of the Schema Scribe application.

These interfaces (`BaseConnector`, `BaseLLMClient`, `BaseWriter`) ensure that
different implementations adhere to a common contract. This makes the system
pluggable and easy to extend with new databases, LLM providers, or output formats.
